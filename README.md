# Window-selection
Chose an optimal window for sensor-collected (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope) data and save the transformed DF for further experiments. Used if the rate/frequency at which the data was collected is unknown. NOTE: might substantially increase the dimensiality of the DS, RAM issues possible.
